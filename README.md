## 1 Introduction
The \src folder contains the entire MATLAB implementations of all the numerical experiments in Jiang et al. (2023). The codes are split into the following three folders.  
- \Example1 contains codes for numerical experiments in Section 6.1.  
- \Example2 contains codes for numerical experiments in Section 6.2.  
- \Example3 contains codes for numerical experiments in Section 6.3.  
## 2 Environment
The codes were written and run in MATLAB R2022a, on Windows 10 Professional 64-bit OS, with lntel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU\@3.00GHz. 256GB RAM
